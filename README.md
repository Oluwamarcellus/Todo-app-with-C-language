****STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT****

Comprenhensive details about how the program works is commented inside the source code, please check it out

For now, the app can...
1. Create a file for user to keep all their todo
2. Add countless number of TODO
3. Adds TODO with the current date and time
4. Saves todo in a file so when user logs out or exit the app and return later, their saved TODO is still intact and nothing is lost
5. Display all TODO
6. Search for todo with todo title
7. Update todo keeping the order and time intact

//TO BE ADDED...

1. Delete TODO
2. Create separate file for users so each user can only be limited to their own TODO

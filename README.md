1. Create a file for user to keep all their todo
2. Add countless of TODO
3. Adds TODO with the current date and time
4. Saves todo in a file so when user logs out or exit the app and return later, their saved TODO is still intact and nothing is lost
5. Display all TODO

6. Search for TODO
7. Delete TODO
8. Create separate file for users so each user can only be limited to their own TODO
